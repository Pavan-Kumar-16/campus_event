From the assignment, I understood that the goal is to create a system where students can easily discover, register for, attend, and provide feedback on campus events, while administrators can manage events and generate reports. The system aims to centralize event information in one platform, reducing confusion from scattered notifications like posters or WhatsApp messages.

Students should be able to browse events, register for those they are interested in, mark attendance during the event, and submit feedback afterward. At the same time, the system needs to track registrations and attendance accurately and provide simple reporting for administrators to evaluate event participation and feedback. Access control is important, allowing only authorized users to create events and preventing duplicate entries or multiple feedback submissions from the same student. For the MVP, the focus is on core functionalities like event creation, registration, attendance tracking, and feedback.
